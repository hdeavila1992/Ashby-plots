# Ashby plots in python
 Simple script to generate Ashby plots based on generic material property data. This package allows
 * creation of custom guidelines to define material indices (e.g., $\frac{E^{1/2}}{\rho}$),
 * plotting of discrete points (e.g., highlighting where Aluminum falls on a stiffness-density plot),
 * the ability to superimpose your own data on top of an Ashby plot (especially helpful for metamaterial work), and
 * a variety of quality-of-life plotting features to generate publication-worthy figures quickly. 

 Here's a sample Ashby plot generated by the package:

 ## Requirements

This package is compatible with Python 3.9 and above.
Here is a complete list of dependencies:

   * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
   * [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
   * [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
   * [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
   * [scipy](https://scipy.org/)

## Usage

* Material properties are stored in an `.xlsx` file in the `material_properties` directory. These properties are taken from the open-source [`material_database` repository](https://github.com/nicoguaro/material_database). If you'd like to include your own material database, add a similarly formatted xlsx file to the directory and change the `file_name` variable.  Two different sheets are distributed with this package:
   1.   `common_material_properties.xlsx` includes material property ranges for common materials. This is useful to plot ellipses. 
   2. `single_material_properties.xlsx` includes average properties for each material. 

* Specify the quantities for the x- and y-axes. **Note: These quantities are case-sensitive to match the .xslx file.**
* Specify your axes limits. 
* If you'd like to plot a material index guideline, set the `guideline_flag == True`. Then, modify the fields of the guideline dictionary to plot it in the desired location and with the correct annotation. Note that this step typically takes a bit of trial and error; any enhancements are welcome here. 
* Finally, if you'd like to plot individual materials on the figure, set the `individual_material_flag` to True and enter your properties as dictionary fields.
* Launch the script by running `plot_ashby.py` and generate your figure!

It is expected that the precise formatting will take some iteration, but hopefully you find this useful.

## Methods
This package is a collection of a few different functions found on StackOverflow and GitHub:

1. The sample material data is a modified version of [nicogauro's `material_database` repository](https://github.com/nicoguaro/material_database).
2. Each material "family" is enclosed via a convex hull. This code is heavily inspired by [Pablo's answer on StackOverflow to a similar question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17557853/991496).

## Enhancements
The code is currently in beta, so further development will focus on making it more user friendly as well as adding the possibility to contextualize your own material data with common material data. 
If you have any ideas for needed enhancements or quality-of-life improvements, please open an issue.
