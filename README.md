# Ashby Plotting
 Simple script to generate Ashby plots based on generic material property data. This package allows
 * creation of custom guidelines to define material indices (e.g., $\frac{E^{1/2}}{\rho}$),
 * plotting of discrete points (e.g., highlighting where Aluminum falls on a $E$-$\rho$ plot),
 * the ability to superimpose your own data on top of an Ashby plot (especially helpful for metamaterial work), and
 * a variety of quality-of-life plotting features to generate publication-worthy figures quickly. 

 Here's a sample Ashby plot generated by the package:
